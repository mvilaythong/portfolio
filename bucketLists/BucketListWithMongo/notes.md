1) Third party decides what the endpoints are.
2) How the data will be sent - XML, JSON <- may way now, XML for older systems

Serving an API - rules
1) YOU (we)  decide what the endpoints are
2) WE decide how the data will be sent - XML or JSON (or other ways)
3) WE decide how much data will be sent back
4) WE decide what specific data we are returning
